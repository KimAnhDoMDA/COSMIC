    title: "PRECISE: Personalized Integrated Network Modeling of the Cancer Proteome Atlas"
    excerpt: "Personalized (patient-specific) approaches have recently emerged with a precision medicine paradigm that acknowledges the fact that molecular pathway structures and activity might be considerably different within and across tumors. The functional cancer genome and proteome provide rich sources of information to identify patient-specific variations in signaling pathways and activities within and across tumors; however, current analytic methods lack the ability to exploit the diverse and multi-layered architecture of these complex biological networks."

    excerpt: "Network-based analyses of high-throughput genomics data provide a holistic, systems-level understanding of various biological mechanisms for a common population. However, when estimating multiple networks across heterogeneous sub-populations, varying sample sizes pose a challenge in the estimation and inference, as network differences may be driven by differences in power."

It is important to understand how these networks change under different stress conditions and/or patient-specific groups to infer differential patterns of activation and inhibition."

    excerpt: "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely used to decompose complex tissues into functionally distinct cell types. The first and usually the most important step of scRNA-seq data analysis is to accurately annotate the cell labels. In recent years, many supervised annotation methods have been developed and shown to be more convenient and accurate than unsupervised cell clustering."

    excerpt: "Oral mucositis (OM) is a common and clinically impactful side effect of cytotoxic cancer treatment, particularly in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who undergo radiotherapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy. The etiology and pathogenic mechanisms of OM are complex, multifaceted and elicit both direct and indirect damage to the mucosa. In this narrative review, we describe studies that use various omics methodologies (genomics, transcriptomics, microbiomics and metabolomics) in attempts to elucidate the biological pathways associated with the development or severity of OM."

Here, we investigate whether increases in circulating microbial-related metabolites associate with PaCa risk by applying metabolomics profiling to 172 sera collected within 5 years prior to PaCa diagnosis and 863 matched non-subject sera from participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) cohort."

    title: "Study finds link between oral microbiome and common side effect in patients with head and neck cancer"
    excerpt: "Oral mucositis refers to erythematous and ulcerative lesions of the oral mucosa observed in patients with cancer being treated with chemotherapy, and/or with radiation therapy to fields involving the oral cavity. Lesions of oral mucositis are often very painful and compromise nutrition and oral hygiene as well as increase risk for local and systemic infection. Mucositis can also involve other areas of the alimentary tract; for example, gastrointestinal (GI) mucositis can manifest as diarrhea. Thus, mucositis is a highly significant and sometimes dose-limiting complication of cancer therapy"

    often have a causal interpretation under conditions on the environments
    and type of invariance imposed. One recent example, the Causal Dantzig
    (CD), is consistent under hidden confounding and represents an alternative to classical instrumental variable estimators such as Two Stage Least
    Squares (TSLS)."

    excerpt: "In microbiome data analysis, unsupervised clustering is often used to identify naturally occurring clusters, which can then be assessed for associations with characteristics of interest. In this work, we systematically compared beta diversity and clustering methods commonly used in microbiome analyses. We applied these to four published datasets where highly distinct microbiome profiles could be seen between sample groups, as well a clinical dataset with less clear separation between groups."

Our method trains an autoencoder with the labeled training data and applies the autoencoder to the testing data to obtain reconstruction errors. By iteratively selecting features that demonstrate a bi-modal pattern and reclustering the cells using the selected feature, our method can accurately identify novel cells that are not present in the training data."

HMA treatment failure is a major clinical problem and its mechanisms are poorly characterized. We performed RNA sequencing in CD34+ bone marrow stem hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (BM-HSPCs) from 51 patients with CMML and MDS before HMA treatment and compared transcriptomic signatures between responders and nonresponders."
