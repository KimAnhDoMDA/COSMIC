    title: "Attempts to Understand Oral Mucositis in Head and Neck Cancer Patients through Omics Studies: A Narrative Review"
    excerpt: "Oral mucositis (OM) is a common and clinically impactful side effect of cytotoxic cancer treatment, particularly in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who undergo radiotherapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy. The etiology and pathogenic mechanisms of OM are complex, multifaceted and elicit both direct and indirect damage to the mucosa. In this narrative review, we describe studies that use various omics methodologies (genomics, transcriptomics, microbiomics and metabolomics) in attempts to elucidate the biological pathways associated with the development or severity of OM."

    excerpt: "Emerging evidence implicates microbiome involvement in the development of pancreatic cancer (PaCa). Here, we investigate whether increases in circulating microbial-related metabolites associate with PaCa risk by applying metabolomics profiling to 172 sera collected within 5 years prior to PaCa diagnosis and 863 matched non-subject sera from participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) cohort."

    title: "Study finds link between oral microbiome and common side effect in patients with head and neck cancer"
    excerpt: "Oral mucositis refers to erythematous and ulcerative lesions of the oral mucosa observed in patients with cancer being treated with chemotherapy, and/or with radiation therapy to fields involving the oral cavity. Lesions of oral mucositis are often very painful and compromise nutrition and oral hygiene as well as increase risk for local and systemic infection. Mucositis can also involve other areas of the alimentary tract; for example, gastrointestinal (GI) mucositis can manifest as diarrhea. Thus, mucositis is a highly significant and sometimes dose-limiting complication of cancer therapy"

    title: "Estimating Causal Effects with Hidden Confounding using Instrumental Variables and Environments"
    excerpt: "Recent works have proposed regression models which are invariant across data collection environments [24, 20, 11, 16, 8]. These estimators
    often have a causal interpretation under conditions on the environments
    and type of invariance imposed. One recent example, the Causal Dantzig
    (CD), is consistent under hidden confounding and represents an alternative to classical instrumental variable estimators such as Two Stage Least
    Squares (TSLS)."

    title: "Performance determinants of unsupervised clustering methods for microbiome data"
    excerpt: "In microbiome data analysis, unsupervised clustering is often used to identify naturally occurring clusters, which can then be assessed for associations with characteristics of interest. In this work, we systematically compared beta diversity and clustering methods commonly used in microbiome analyses. We applied these to four published datasets where highly distinct microbiome profiles could be seen between sample groups, as well a clinical dataset with less clear separation between groups."

    excerpt: "We developed a straightforward yet effective method combining autoencoder with iterative feature selection to automatically identify novel cells from scRNA-seq data. Our method trains an autoencoder with the labeled training data and applies the autoencoder to the testing data to obtain reconstruction errors. By iteratively selecting features that demonstrate a bi-modal pattern and reclustering the cells using the selected feature, our method can accurately identify novel cells that are not present in the training data."

    excerpt: "The successful development and implementation of precision immuno-oncology therapies requires a deeper understanding of the immune architecture at a patient level. T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing is a relatively new technology that enables monitoring of T-cells, a subset of immune cells that play a central role in modulating immune response."

    excerpt: "Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are the standard of care for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). HMA treatment failure is a major clinical problem and its mechanisms are poorly characterized. We performed RNA sequencing in CD34+ bone marrow stem hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (BM-HSPCs) from 51 patients with CMML and MDS before HMA treatment and compared transcriptomic signatures between responders and nonresponders."

Recent studies indicated that function of wildtype TP53 positively impacts outcome of HMA treatments. We investigated the combination of the...."
